              <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. There are no limits in this world. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.
      
                  <p class="bodycopy3">We'll have a super time. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Fluff that up. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p> 
                  
                  <p class="bodycopy2">There we are. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Every time you practice, you learn more. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>
                  
                  <p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
                  
                  <img src="Images/CaraHeadshot.jpg" alt="Cara Serio Headshot" class="right-photo">
                  
                  <p>Anything you want to do you can do here. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Let that brush dance around there and play. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.</p>
                  
                  <p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.</p>
                  
                  <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Anyone can paint. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.</p>
